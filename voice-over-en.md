## 1 — Mono

*(The source moves. Nothing changes perceptually.)*

Listen....
(⏱️=2s)
The sound is moving, but it doesn’t feel like it.
(⏱️=0.5s)
It stays here: in the center, fixed... That’s mono.
(⏱️=0.5s)
Both of your ears are receiving the exact same signal: no difference in timing, no difference in level, no spatial information.
(⏱️=0.5s)
Your brain is trying to locate the sound, but there’s nothing to compute. So space collapses into a single point.


*(Let the movement continue silently for a moment.)*

## 2 — Stereo

*(Switch to left-right panning.)*

Now… something changed...
<break time="2s" />
You can hear motion...
<break time="1s" />
Left...
<break time="1s" />
Right...
<break time="1s" />
This is stereo.
<break time="0.5s" />
Your brain compares the two ears. If sound arrives earlier to the left ear, or slightly louder, your brain places it on the left.
<break time="0.5s" />
These tiny differences are called Interaural Time Differences and Interaural Level Differences. They’re measured in microseconds and fractions of a decibel.
<break time="0.5s" />
With just that… your brain creates width.
<break time="0.5s" />
But listen closely. Can you tell if the sound is in front of you or behind you?
<break time="2s" />
Above or below you?
<break time="2s" />
Probably not. Because stereo creates a line, not a space.

## 3 — Binaural

*(Switch to full HRTF rendering. The source moves around.)*

Now… listen again.
<break time="2s" />
The sound isn’t on a line anymore. It surrounds you: it has depth, height, distance.
<break time="0.5s" />
This is binaural audio.
<break time="0.5s" />
Instead of just balancing volume between ears, we simulate how sound interacts with your body. Your head blocks high frequencies. Your ears reshape the spectrum. Your shoulders reflect sound upward.
<break time="0.5s" />
Every direction in space leaves a unique acoustic signature before the sound reaches your eardrums.
<break time="0.5s" />
That signature is called a Head-Related Transfer Function. Or simply… HRTF.

## 4 — The Brain

Your brain has been learning your HRTF your entire life. It knows how “behind you” sounds. How “above you” sounds. How “close” feels different from “far.” It decodes tiny changes in frequency, timing, and intensity… And reconstructs space. Instantly.

## 5 — Closing

Spatial audio isn’t an illusion. It’s physics, shaped by anatomy and interpreted by the brain.
When we reproduce those transformations accurately… space emerges. Not from your headphones. From your brain.

*(Soft ending. Let the sound move freely.)*
